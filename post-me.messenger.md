## Messenger interface

An interface used internally to exchange low level messages across contexts.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Messenger 
```

## Remarks

Having a single interface lets post-me deal with Workers, Windows, and MessagePorts without having to worry about their differences.

A few concrete implementations of the Messenger interface are provided.

## Methods
